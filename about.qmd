## Real World Data Workforce Development Across the Translational Spectrum

### Overview

The Real World Data (RWD) Workforce Development Across the Translational Spectrum Working Group will create a RWD needs assessment, resource inventory, and design a generalizable competency framework. RWD topics are expected to include, but are not limited to, data collection and provenance, clinical data models, evaluation of bias in the data, and best practices and analytic approaches that support ethical research analytics using RWD (including AI and machine learning modeling) and clinical decision support tools. This Working Group will also establish a training community that fosters knowledge and training artifact exchange.

## About This Dashboard

This dashboard visualizes the RWD Working Group resource inventory collected as part of our educational asset inventory initiative. The data is sourced directly from a collaborative Google Sheets document and displayed using interactive visualizations built with R and Quarto.

### Contributing to the Inventory

To add resources to the inventory:

1. Visit the [Google Sheets inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L8VTkbA0bsEYAceLyYebYPxwETYyF2jzdvoCuqibE-s/edit)
2. Follow the instructions in the "Instructions" tab
3. Add your resource information to the "Inventory" tab
4. The dashboard will automatically reflect your additions on the next page load

### Technology Stack
