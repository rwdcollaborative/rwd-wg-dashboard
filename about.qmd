## Real World Data Workforce Development Across the Translational Spectrum

### Overview

The Real World Data (RWD) Workforce Development Across the Translational Spectrum Working Group will create a RWD needs assessment, resource inventory, and design a generalizable competency framework. RWD topics are expected to include, but are not limited to, data collection and provenance, clinical data models, evaluation of bias in the data, and best practices and analytic approaches that support ethical research analytics using RWD (including AI and machine learning modeling) and clinical decision support tools. This Working Group will also establish a training community that fosters knowledge and training artifact exchange.

### Group Goals

## About This Dashboard

This dashboard visualizes the RWD Working Group resource inventory collected as part of our educational asset inventory initiative. The data is sourced directly from a collaborative Google Sheets document and displayed using interactive visualizations built with R and Quarto.

### Contributing to the Inventory

To add resources to the inventory:

1. Open the [Submit Resource](submit.qmd) page and complete the form.
2. Submit your resource.
3. The dashboard will reflect additions on the next page load.

You can still add entries directly in the [Google Sheets inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L8VTkbA0bsEYAceLyYebYPxwETYyF2jzdvoCuqibE-s/edit) if needed.

### Technology Stack

- **Quarto**: Modern document publishing system
- **R**: Statistical computing and graphics (googlesheets4, plotly, dplyr, DT)
- **GitHub Pages**: Free, reliable static site hosting
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment
