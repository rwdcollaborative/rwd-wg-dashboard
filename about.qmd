## About This Dashboard

This dashboard visualizes the Real World Data (RWD) Working Group resource inventory. The data is sourced directly from a collaborative Google Sheets document and displayed using interactive visualizations built with R and Quarto.

### Purpose

The RWD Working Group maintains a comprehensive inventory of resources related to real-world data in clinical and translational research. This dashboard provides:

- **Quick Overview**: Key metrics about the inventory
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts showing distribution by organization, RWD type, topic, and availability
- **Searchable Table**: Full inventory with filtering and export capabilities

### Key Features

- **Real-time Data**: The dashboard loads data directly from Google Sheets on each page visit, ensuring you always see the latest information
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore the data with interactive charts powered by Plotly
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Export Capabilities**: Download filtered data as CSV or Excel
- **No Maintenance Required**: Automatically updates when the source sheet is modified

### What's Tracked

The dashboard focuses on four key dimensions:

1. **Organization** - Which institutions/organizations are contributing resources
2. **RWD Type** - Types of real-world data (EHR, claims, registries, etc.)
3. **Topic** - Subject areas covered (quality, privacy, methods, etc.)
4. **Availability** - How resources can be accessed
